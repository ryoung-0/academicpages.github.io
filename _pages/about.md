I am currently a PhD Candidate at Scripps Institution of Oceanography on the [NDSEG](https://ndseg.org/) fellowship. I am advised by Dr. Sophia Merrifield in the [CORDC](https://cordc.ucsd.edu/) group.

I am interested in autonomy and optimal path planning for un-crewed systems that operate in dynamic and uncertain environments.
